In order to work with the API, you need an API key. Please sign up (https://orbital-views.appspot.com) 
and check your key in your Profile. The API Key is part of your calls and identifies you.
 
HowTo:

1. Please register a field with a polygon and date. It takes some minutes to process the timeseries data. All other API calls ared based on your registered area. 
A polygon can be generated with http://geojson.io/. Please mark an area of interest and save the polygon as 'WKT'. An example for a WKT string is shown in durnast.wkt.
